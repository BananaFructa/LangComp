A 
mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form 
of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or 
volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of 
rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge 
mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect 
the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and 
climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as 
mountain climbing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 
8,850 m (29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar 
System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft ). There is no universally accepted definition of a 
mountain . Elevation , volume , relief , steepness , spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining 
a mountain . In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as "" a natural elevation of the earth 
surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which , relatively to the adjacent 
elevation , is impressive or notable . Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage . 
Mount Scott outside Lawton , Oklahoma , USA , is only 251 m (823 ft ) from its base to 
its highest point . Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states "" Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (2,000 ft 
) as mountains , those below being referred to as hills ." In the United Kingdom and the Republic of 
Ireland , a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m ) high , which 
accords with the official UK government's definition that a mountain , for the purposes of access , is a summit 
of 2,000 feet (610 m ) or higher . In addition , some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement 
, typically 100 or 500 feet (30 or 152 m ). At one time the U .. S . Board 
on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (300 m ) or taller , but has abandoned the 
definition since the 19700 s . Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill . However , 
today , the United States Geological Survey (( USGS ) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in 
the US . London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom , with the largest 
municipal population in the European Union . Standing on the River Thames in the south -- east of England , 
at the head of its 50-- mile (80 km ) estuary leading to the North Sea , London has been 
a major settlement for two millennia . Londinium was founded by the Romans . The City of London , London's 
ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km 2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile 
− retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits . The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough 
holding city status . Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly . London is 
considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's most powerful , 
most desirable , most influential , most visited , most expensive , innovative , sustainable , most investment friendly , 
most popular for work , and the most vegetarian -- friendly city in the world . London exerts a considerable 
impact upon the arts , commerce , education , entertainment , fashion , finance , healthcare , media , professional 
services , research and development , tourism and transportation . London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic 
performance . It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area 
GDP . It is the most -- visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest city airport 
system as measured by passenger traffic . It is the leading investment destination , hosting more international retailers and ultra 
high -- net -- worth individuals than any other city . London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education 
institutes in Europe . In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games . 
London has a diverse range of people and cultures , and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region 
. Its estimated mid -2018 municipal population (( corresponding to Greater London ) was 8,908,081, the most populous of any 
city in the European Union and accounting for 13.4% of the UK population . London's urban area is the second 
most populous in the EU , after Paris , with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census . The population within 
the London commuter belt is the most populous in the EU with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016. London was the world's 
most populous city from c . 1831 to 1925. London contains four World Heritage Sites : the Tower of London 
; Kew Gardens ; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster , Westminster Abbey , and St Margaret's Church ; 
and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory , Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian , 00 ° longitude 
, and Greenwich Mean Time . Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace , the London Eye , Piccadilly Circus , St 
Paul's Cathedral , Tower Bridge , Trafalgar Square and The Shard . London has numerous museums , galleries , libraries 
and sporting events . These include the British Museum , National Gallery , Natural History Museum , Tate Modern , 
British Library and West End theatres . The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world . 
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 55 th century , London ceased to be a capital , 
and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned , although Roman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin 
-- in -- the -- Fields until around 450. From around 500, an Anglo -- Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic 
developed slightly west of the old Roman city . By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port 
, although there is little evidence of large -- scale production . From the 8200 s repeated Viking assaults brought 
decline . Three are recorded ; those in 851 and 886 succeeded , while the last , in 994, was 
rebuffed . The Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England ; its boundary stretched roughly from London 
to Chester . It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally 
agreed by the Danish warlord , Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo -- 
Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred "" refounded " London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic 
and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls . London then grew slowly until about 950, 
after which activity increased dramatically . By the 111 th century , London was beyond all comparison the largest town 
in England . Westminster Abbey , rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor , was one of 
the grandest churches in Europe . Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo -- Saxon England , but from 
this time on , London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of 
war . In the view of Frank Stenton : "" It had the resources , and it was rapidly developing 
the dignity and the political self -- consciousness appropriate to a national capital ." Budapest (// ˈbuːdəpɛst /, Hungarian pronunciation 
: [[ ˈbudɒpɛʃt ]) is the capital and the most populous city of Hungary , and the tenth -- largest 
city in the European Union by population within city limits .[9][10][11] The city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over 
a land area of about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles ).[12] Budapest is both a city and county , 
and forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area , which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square 
miles ) and a population of 3,303,786, comprising 33% of the population of Hungary .[13][14]] The history of Budapest began 
when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum ,[15][16] the capital of Lower Pannonia .[15] The 
Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 99 th century .[17] The area was pillaged by the Mongols in 
1241.[18] Buda , the settlements on the west bank of the river , became one of the centres of Renaissance 
humanist culture by the 155 th century .[19][20][21] The Battle of Mohács , in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 
years of Ottoman rule .[22] After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity 
. Pest -- Buda became a global city with the unification of Buda , Óbuda , and Pest on 17 
November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital .[12][23] Budapest also became the co -- capital of 
the Austro -- Hungarian Empire ,[24] a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I . The city 
was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the Hungarian Revolution 
of 1956.[25][26]] Budapest is an Alpha − global city with strengths in commerce , finance , media , art , 
fashion , research , technology , education , and entertainment .[27][28] It is Hungary's financial centre [29] and was ranked 
as the second fastest -- developing urban economy in Europe .[30] Budapest is the headquarters of the European Institute of 
Innovation and Technology ,[31] the European Police College [32] and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency 
.[33] Over 40 colleges and universities are located in Budapest , including the Eötvös Loránd University , the Semmelweis University 
and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics .[34][35] Opened in 1896,[36] the city's subway system , the Budapest Metro 
, serves 1.27 million , while the Budapest Tram Network serves 1.08 million passengers daily .[37]] Among Budapest's important museums 
and cultural institutions is the Museum of Fine Arts . Further famous cultural institutions are the Hungarian National Museum , 
House of Terror , Franz Liszt Academy of Music , Hungarian State Opera House and National Széchényi Library . The 
central area of the city along the Danube River is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has several 
notable monuments , including the Hungarian Parliament , Buda Castle , Fisherman's Bastion , Gresham Palace , Széchenyi Chain Bridge 
, Matthias Church and the Liberty Statue .[38] Other famous landmarks include Andrássy Avenue , St . Stephen's Basilica , 
Heroes' Square , the Great Market Hall , the Nyugati Railway Station built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 
1877 and the second -- oldest metro line in the world , the Millennium Underground Railway .[39] The city also 
has around 80 geothermal springs ,[40] the largest thermal water cave system ,[41] second largest synagogue , and third largest 
Parliament building in the world .[42] Budapest attracts 4.4 million international tourists per year , making it a popular destination 
in Europe .[43] The previously separate towns of Buda , Óbuda , and Pest were in 1873 officially unified [44] 
and given the new name Budapest . Before this , the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as 
"" Pest -- Buda ".[45][46] Pest has also been sometimes used colloquially as a shortened name for Budapest .[45]] All 
varieties of English pronounce the -- s - as in the English word pest . The -- u in Buda 
- is pronounced either // u / like food (( as in US : // ˈbuːdəpɛst /[47]) or // ju 
/ like cue (( as in UK : // ˌb (( j )) uːdəˈpɛst , ˌbʊd -, ˈb (( j 
)) uːdəpɛst , ˈbʊd -/). In Hungarian , the -- s - is pronounced // ʃ / as in wash 
; in IPA : Hungarian : [[ ˈbudɒpɛʃt ] (( About this soundlisten ).. The origin of the names "" 
Buda " and "" Pest " is obscure . Buda wasprobably the name of the first constable of the fortress 
built on the Castle Hill in the 111 th century [48]] or a derivative of Bod or Bud , a 
personal name of Turkic origin , meaning 'twig' .[49]] or a Slavic personal name , Buda , the short form 
of Budimír , Budivoj .[50]] Linguistically , however , a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода (( voda , 
water ) is not possible , and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word 
buta ~ buda 'branch , twig' .[51]] According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages , "" 
Buda " comes from the name of its founder , Bleda , brother of Hunnic ruler Attila .. There are 
several theories about Pest . One [52] states that the name derives from Roman times , since there was a 
local fortress (( Contra -- Aquincum ) called by Ptolemaios "" Pession " ("" Πέσσιον ", iii .7.. § 2).[53] 
Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave , пещера , or peštera . A third 
cites пещ , or pešt , referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln .[54] The first settlement on 
the territory of Budapest was built by Celts [15] before 1 AD . It was later occupied by the Romans 
. The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD .[15] At first 
it was a military settlement , and gradually the city rose around it , making it the focal point of 
the city's commercial life . Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest .[55] The Romans constructed roads 
, amphitheaters , baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp .[56] The Roman city of Aquincum 
is the best -- conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary . The archaeological site was turned into a museum 
with inside and open -- air sections .[57]] The Magyar tribes led by Árpád , forced out of their original 
homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh , settled in the territory at the 
end of the 99 th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest ,[17][58] and 
a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary .[17] Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an 
early place of central power near what became Budapest .[59] The Tatar invasion in the 133 th century quickly proved 
it is difficult to defend a plain .[12][17] King Béla IV of Hungary therefore ordered the construction of reinforced stone 
walls around the towns [17] and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda 
. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary .[18][12]] The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the 
reign of King Matthias Corvinus . The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city . His library , 
the Bibliotheca Corviniana , was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 155 th 
century , and second in size only to the Vatican Library .[12] After the foundation of the first Hungarian university 
in Pécs in 1367 (( University of Pécs ), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 (( University 
of Óbuda ).[60] The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473.[61] Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around 1500.[62] 
The Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.[63] The Turkish Rule lasted 
for more than 150 years .[12] The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city .[17] Some of 
the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later (( Rudas Baths and 
Király Baths ). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand , and by 1647 it 
had fallen to only about seventy .[62] The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg Monarchy 
as Royal Hungary .. In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda , a renewed campaign was started 
to enter the Hungarian capital . This time , the Holy League's army was twice as large , containing over 
74,000 men , including German , Croat , Dutch , Hungarian , English , Spanish , Czech , Italian , 
French , Burgundian , Danish and Swedish soldiers , along with other Europeans as volunteers , artillerymen , and officers 
. The Christian forces seized Buda , and in the next few years , all of the former Hungarian lands 
, except areas near Temesvár (( Timișoara ), were taken from the Turks . In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz 
, these territorial changes were officially recognized to show the end of the rule of the Turks , and in 
1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule . The 199 th century was dominated by the 
Hungarian struggle for independence [12] and modernisation . The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 
1848 and was defeated one and a half years later , with the help of the Russian Empire . 1867 
was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria -- Hungary . This made Budapest the twin 
capital of a dual monarchy . It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the 
history of Budapest , lasting until World War I . In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was 
opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube [64] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with 
the third part , Óbuda (( Old Buda ), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest . The dynamic Pest 
grew into the country's administrative , political , economic , trade and cultural hub . Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in 
the second half of the 199 th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian 
Plain . Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language 
, and German was crowded out . The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.[65][66][67] Due to the prosperity 
and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 200 th century , Budapest was often 
called the "" Jewish Mecca "[18] or "" Judapest ".[68][69] In 1918, Austria -- Hungary lost the war and collapsed 
; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (( Republic of Hungary ). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the 
country , and as a result , Hungary lost over two -- thirds of its territory , and about two 
-- thirds of its inhabitants , including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians .[70][71]] In 1944, a year 
before the end of World War II , Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (( first 
attack 4 April 1944[72][73][74]). From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of 
Budapest . Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian 
troops . More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict . All bridges were destroyed by the Germans 
. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war .[75]] Between 
20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party , during the German 
occupation of Hungary , from 1944 to early 1945.[76]] Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by 
issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings , including the now famous Glass House (( Üvegház ) at Vadász 
Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory . About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in 
a neighboring building . Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by 
giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection .[77] Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 
17 January 1945 and never regained freedom . Giorgio Perlasca , an Italian citizen , saved thousands of Hungarian Jews 
posing as a Spanish diplomat .[78][79] Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews . There are two 
monuments for Wallenberg , one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest .. Following the liberation of 
Hungary from Nazi Germany by the Red Army , Soviet military occupation ensued , which ended only in 1991. The 
Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs . In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic (( People's 
Republic of Hungary ). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime 
, and during the 19500 s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (( also see Stalin 
era ). On 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform . The demonstrators 
went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands . The regime ordered troops to shoot into 
the crowd . Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building . This 
initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary . 
To their surprise , the central committee of the "" Hungarian Working People's Party " did so that same evening 
. This uprising was an anti -- Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November . After Nagy 
had declared that Hungary was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral , Soviet tanks and troops entered the 
country to crush the revolt . Fighting continued until mid November , leaving more than 3000 dead . A monument 
was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park . Its 
shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny , ending in 
an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership .[80]] From the 19600 s to the late 
19800 s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "" the happiest barrack " within the Eastern bloc , and 
much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired . Work on Erzsébet Bridge , the last to 
be rebuilt , was finished in 1964. In the early 19700 s , Budapest Metro's East -- West M 2 
line was first opened , followed by the M 3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks 
of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites . Andrássy Avenue (( including the Millennium 
Underground Railway , Hősök tere , and Városliget ) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 19800 
s , the city's population reached 2.1 million . In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due 
to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county , i .. e ., suburbanisation .[81]] In the 
last decades of the 200 th century the political changes of 19899 – 90 (( Fall of the Iron Curtain 
) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest . The monuments of the dictatorship were removed 
from public places , into Memento Park . In the first 20 years of the new democracy , the development 
of the city was managed by its mayor , Gábor Demszky .[82] Canada is a country in the northern part 
of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into 
the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles ), making it the world's second -- 
largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi 
), is the world's longest bi -- national land border . Canada's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest 
metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver .. As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , the 
majority of its land area being dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 
80 per cent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium -- sized cities , and 70 per cent residing 
within 100 kilometres (62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada's climate varies widely across its vast area , 
ranging from arctic weather in the north , to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons 
.. Various Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in 
the 166 th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a 
consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, 
with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of 
four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United 
Kingdom . This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 
of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament .. Canada is a parliamentary democracy and 
a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition , with a monarch and a prime minister who serves as the chair 
of the Cabinet and head of government . The country is a realm within the Commonwealth of Nations , a 
member of the Francophonie and officially bilingual at the federal level . It ranks among the highest in international measurements 
of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education . It is one 
of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large -- scale immigration from many other 
countries . Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and 
culture .. A developed country , Canada has the sixteenth -- highest nominal per capita income globally as well as 
the twelfth -- highest ranking in the Human Development Index . Its advanced economy is the tenth -- largest in 
the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well -- developed international trade networks . Canada is 
part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
, the G 7 (( formerly G 8), the Group of Ten , the G 20, the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the Asia -- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . While a variety of theories have been postulated for 
the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the St . Lawrence Iroquoian word 
kanata , meaning "" village " or "" settlement ".[11] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present -- day Quebec 
City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona .[12] Cartier later used 
the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (( 
the chief at Stadacona );[12] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the 
Saint Lawrence River as Canada .[12]] From the 166 th to the early 188 th century "" Canada " referred 
to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River .[13] In 1791, the area became two 
British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named the Canadas ; until their union as the British Province 
of Canada in 1841.[14] Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at 
the London Conference , and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title .[15] By the 19500 s , 
the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom , which considered Canada a "" Realm 
of the Commonwealth ". The government of Louis St . Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes 
of Canada in 1951.[16] In 1982, the passage of the Canada Act , bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under 
Canadian control , referred only to Canada , and later that year the name of the national holiday was changed 
from Dominion Day to Canada Day .[17] The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces 
, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion .[18] Indigenous peoples in present -- day 
Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Métis ,[19] the last being a mixed -- blood people who 
originated in the mid -177 th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers .[19] The term "" 
Aboriginal " as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents , including the 
Constitution Act 1982.[20]] The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of 
the Bering land bridge [21] and arrived at least 14,000 years ago .[22] The Paleo -- Indian archeological sites at 
Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada .[23] The characteristics 
of Canadian Indigenous societies included permanent settlements , agriculture , complex societal hierarchies , and trading networks .[24][25] Some of 
these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 155 th and early 166 th centuries 
and have only been discovered through archeological investigations .[26]] The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements 
is estimated to have been between 200,000[27] and two million ,[28] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples .[29] As a consequence of European colonization , the population of Canada's Indigenous peoples declined by 
forty to eighty percent , and several First Nations , such as the Beothuk , disappeared .[30] The decline is 
attributed to several causes , including the transfer of European diseases , such as influenza , measles , and smallpox 
to which they had no natural immunity ,[27][31] conflicts over the fur trade , conflicts with the colonial authorities and 
settlers , and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self -- sufficiency 
.[32][33]] Although not without conflict , European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful .[34] 
First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada , particularly for 
their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American 
fur trade .[35] The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period , though the Inuit , 
in general , had more limited interaction with European settlers .[36] However , from the late 188 th century , 
European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture .[37] These attempts reached a climax in the late 
199 th and early 200 th centuries with forced integration and relocations .[38] A period of redress is underway , 
which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[39] 
In about 1000 CE , the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux 
Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland .[40][41] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot 
explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England .[42][43] Then Basque and Portuguese 
mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 166 th century .[44] In 1534, 
French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where , on July 24, he planted a 10-- metre 
(33 ft ) cross bearing the words "" Long Live the King of France " and took possession of the 
territory New France in the name of King Francis I .[45] In general , the settlements appear to have been 
seasonal and short -- lived , possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and 
the problems of navigating trade routes at that time .[46]] In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative 
of Queen Elizabeth I , founded St . John's , Newfoundland , as the first North American English colony .[47] 
French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal (( in 
1605) and Quebec City (( in 1608).[48] Among the colonists of New France , Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence 
River valley and Acadians settled the present -- day Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great 
Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana .[49] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid 
-177 th century over control of the North American fur trade .[50] The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland , 
beginning in 1610[51] and the Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after .[44] A series of four wars 
erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre 
of the Seven Years' War .[52] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , 
and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War .[53]] The 
Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights , created the Province of Quebec out of New France , 
and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia .[17] St . John's Island (( now Prince Edward Island ) became 
a separate colony in 1769.[54] To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, 
expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley . More importantly , the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special 
autonomy and rights of self -- administration at a time the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule .[55] 
It re -- established the French language , Catholic faith , and French civil law there , staving off the 
growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies . The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn 
angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies , further fuelling anti -- British sentiment in the years prior to the 
American Revolution .[17]] After the successful American War of Independence , the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of 
the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace , ceding British North American territories south of the 
Great Lakes to the new country .[56] The American war of independence also caused a large out -- migration of 
Loyalists , the settlers who had fought against American independence . Many moved to Canada , particularly Atlantic Canada , 
where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories . New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova 
Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of Saint John 
, New Brunswick to become Canada's first city .[57] To accommodate the influx of English -- speaking Loyalists in Central 
Canada , the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French -- speaking Lower Canada (( later 
Quebec ) and English -- speaking Upper Canada (( later Ontario ), granting each its own elected legislative assembly .[58] 
The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom . 
Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed . Immigration resumed at a higher level , with over 960,000 arrivals 
from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[59] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic -- 
speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances .[60] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated 
to Canada before 1891.[27]] The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[61] The Durham Report subsequently 
recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture .[17] The Act of Union merged the Canadas 
into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849.[62] 
The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute , 
extending the border westward along the 499 th parallel . This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island 
(1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[63] The Alaska Purchase of 1867 by the United States established the border along the 
Pacific coast , although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the Alaska -- Yukon 
and Alaska -- BC border for years to come .[64] Following several constitutional conferences , the Constitution Act officially proclaimed 
Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces : Ontario , Quebec , Nova Scotia , and New 
Brunswick .[65][66] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North -- Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories , 
where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[67] 
British Columbia and Vancouver Island (( which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward 
Island joined in 1873.[68] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population immigrated southwards , to the 
U .. S .[69]] To open the West to European immigration , parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three 
transcontinental railways (( including the Canadian Pacific Railway ), opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act , 
and establishing the North -- West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory .[70][71] In 1898, during the 
Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories , parliament created the Yukon Territory . Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 
1905.[68] Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the Constitution Act , 1867, its declaration of war 
in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I .[72] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of 
the Canadian Corps , which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of 
the war .[73] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I , some 60,000 were killed and 
another 172,000 were wounded .[74] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's 
dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French -- speaking Quebecers .[75] The Military 
Service Act brought in compulsory military service , though it , coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec 
, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party .[75] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations 
independently of Britain ,[73] and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence .[4] The Great Depression in Canada during 
the early 19300 s saw an economic downturn , leading to hardship across the country .[76] In response to the 
downturn , the Co -- operative Commonwealth Federation (( CCF ) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state 
(( as pioneered by Tommy Douglas ) in the 19400 s and 19500 s .[77] On the advice of Prime 
Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI , 
seven days after the United Kingdom . The delay underscored Canada's independence .[73]] The first Canadian Army units arrived in 
Britain in December 1939. In all , over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II 
and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded .[78] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles 
of the war , including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid , the Allied invasion of Italy , the Normandy landings 
, the Battle of Normandy , and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[73] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch 
monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi 
Germany .[79]] The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada , Britain , 
China , and the Soviet Union .[73] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with 
a large army and strong economy .[80] The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland 
to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor .[81] After two bitter 
referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province .[82]] Canada's post -- war economic growth , 
combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments , led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked 
by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965,[83] the implementation of official bilingualism (( English and French ) 
in 1969,[84] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[85] Socially democratic programs were also instituted , such as Medicare 
, the Canada Pension Plan , and Canada Student Loans , though provincial governments , particularly Quebec and Alberta , 
opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions .[86]] Finally , another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the 
Canada Act , the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom , concurrent with the creation of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .[87][88][89] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country , although the Queen retained 
her role as monarch of Canada .[90][91] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with 
the federal government .[92]] At the same time , Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution 
of the 19600 s , giving birth to a secular nationalist movement .[93] The radical Front de libération du Québec 
(( FLQ ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970[94] and the sovereignist Parti 
Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty -- association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism 
constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[95] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec 
and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West .[96][97] A second referendum followed in 1995, in 
which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent .[98] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled 
unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament , outlining the terms 
of a negotiated departure from Confederation .[95]] In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty , a number of crises 
shook Canadian society in the late 19800 s and early 19900 s . These included the explosion of Air India 
Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history ;[99] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university 
shooting targeting female students ;[100] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[101] the first of a number of violent confrontations between 
the government and Indigenous groups .[102] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a U .. 
S .-- led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 19900 s , including the UNPROFOR 
mission in the former Yugoslavia .[103]] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001, but declined to join the U .. 
S .-- led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[104] In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO -- led intervention into 
the Libyan Civil War ,[105] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid 
-20100 s .[106] Canada occupies much of the continent of North America , sharing land borders with the contiguous United 
States to the south , and the U .. S . state of Alaska to the northwest . Canada stretches 
from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west ; to the north lies the 
Arctic Ocean .[107] Greenland is to the northeast and to the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with the Republic 
of France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , the last vestige of New France .[108] By total area 
(( including its waters ), Canada is the second -- largest country in the world , after Russia . By 
land area alone , however , Canada ranks fourth , the difference being due to it having the world's largest 
proportion of fresh water lakes .[109] Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories , only two are landlocked (( Alberta and 
Saskatchewan ) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans .. Canada is home to the world's 
northernmost settlement , Canadian Forces Station Alert , on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.55 °N – 
which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi ) from the North Pole .[110] Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by 
ice and permafrost .[111] Canada has the longest coastline in the world , with a total length of 243,042 kilometres 
(151,019 mi );[112] additionally , its border with the United States is the world's longest land border , stretching 8,891 
kilometres (5,525 mi ).[113] Three of Canada's arctic islands , Baffin Island , Victoria Island and Ellesmere Island , are 
among the ten largest in the world .[114]] Since the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted 
of eight distinct forest regions , including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield .[115] 42 percent of the land 
acreage of Canada is covered by forests , approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land , made up mostly 
of spruce , poplar and pine .[116] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes— 563 greater than 100 km 2 (39 sq 
mi )) —which is more than any other country , containing much of the world's fresh water .[117][118] There are 
also fresh -- water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Mountains .[119] Canada is geologically active , having 
many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes , notably Mount Meager massif , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Cayley massif , and 
the Mount Edziza volcanic complex .[120] The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural 
disasters , killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British 
Columbia .[121] The eruption produced a 22.5-- kilometre (14.0 mi ) lava flow , and , according to Nisga'a legend 
, blocked the flow of the Nass River .[122]] Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region 
to region . Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country , particularly in the interior and Prairie 
provinces , which experience a continental climate , where daily average temperatures are near − 15 °C (5 °F ), 
but can drop below − 40 °C (( − 40 °F ) with severe wind chills .[123] In noncoastal regions 
, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year , while in parts of the north 
snow can persist year -- round . Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate , with a mild and rainy 
winter . On the east and west coasts , average high temperatures are generally in the low 200 s °C 
(700 s °F ), while between the coasts , the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C 
(77 to 86 °F ), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F ).[124] Canada is 
described as a "" full democracy ",[125] with a tradition of liberalism ,[126] and an egalitarian ,[127] moderate political ideology 
.[128] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture .[129] Peace , order , 
and good government , alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian government .[130][131]] At the 
federal level , Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practicing "" brokerage politics ",[[ b ][133][134][135][136] the 
centre -- left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre -- right Conservative Party of Canada (( or its predecessors 
).[137] The historically predominant Liberal Party position themselves at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative 
Party positioned on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left .[138][139][140] Far -- right and far -- 
left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society .[141][142] Five parties had representatives elected to the federal 
parliament in the 2015 election—the Liberal Party , who currently form the government ; the Conservative Party , who are 
the official opposition ; the New Democratic Party ; the Bloc Québécois ; and the Green Party of Canada has 
a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive , 
legislative , and judicial branches .[144][145][146] The reigning monarch is Queen Elizabeth II , who is also monarch of 15 
other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces . The person who is the Canadian monarch is the same 
as the British monarch , although the two institutions are separate .[147] The Queen appoints a representative , the governor 
general (( at present Julie Payette ), to carry out most of her federal royal duties in Canada .[148][149]] The 
direct participation of the monarch and the governor general in areas of governance is limited .[146][150][151] In practice , their 
use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet , a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to 
the elected House of Commons of Canada and chosen and headed by the prime minister (( at present Justin Trudeau 
),[152] the head of government . The governor general or monarch may , though , in certain crisis situations exercise 
their power without ministerial advice .[150] To ensure the stability of government , the governor general will usually appoint as 
prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a 
plurality in the House of Commons .[153] The Prime Minister's Office (( PMO ) is thus one of the most 
powerful institutions in government , initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown , besides 
the aforementioned , the governor general , lieutenant governors , senators , federal court judges , and heads of Crown 
corporations and government agencies .[150] The leader of the party with the second -- most seats usually becomes the leader 
of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check 
.[154] Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an 
electoral district or riding . General elections must be called by the governor general , either on the advice of 
the prime minister or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House .[155][156] Constitutionally , an election may 
be held no more than five years after the preceding election , although the Canada Elections Act limits this to 
four years with a fixed election date in October . The 105 members of the Senate , whose seats are 
apportioned on a regional basis , serve until age 75.[157]] Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government 
and the ten provinces . Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons 
.[151] Canada's three territories also have legislatures , but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the 
provinces .[158] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts .[159]] The Bank of Canada is the central 
bank of the country . In addition , the minister of finance and minister of industry utilize the Statistics Canada 
agency for financial planning and economic policy development .[160] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue 
currency in the form of Canadian bank notes .[161] The bank does not issue Canadian coins ; they are issued 
by the Royal Canadian Mint .[162] The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country , and consists 
of written text and unwritten conventions .[163] The Constitution Act , 1867 (( known as the British North America Act 
prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments .[164] The 
Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act , 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain , 
as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .[165] The Charter guarantees 
basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over -- ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding clause allows the federal 
parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years .[166] The Indian 
Act , various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples .[167] Most notably 
, a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning 
monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[168] These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown -- in -- Council , 
administered by Canadian Aboriginal law , and overseen by the minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations . The role of the treaties 
and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty -- five of the Constitution Act , 1982.[167] These rights 
may include provision of services , such as health care , and exemption from taxation .[169] The legal and policy 
framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord 
.[167] Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament 
that violate the constitution . The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been 
led since December 18, 2017 by Chief Justice Richard Wagner .[170] Its nine members are appointed by the Governor -- 
General on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice . All judges at the superior and appellate 
levels are appointed after consultation with non -- governmental legal bodies . The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior 
courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions .[171]] Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec , where civil law predominates 
. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada .[172] Law enforcement , including criminal courts 
, is officially a provincial responsibility , conducted by provincial and municipal police forces .[173] However , in most rural 
areas and some urban areas , policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police .[174] Canada is 
recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions .[175] Canada's 
foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations , and through the 
work of numerous federal institutions .[176] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 200 th century has played a major role in 
its global image .[177] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium 
Development Goals , while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises .[178]] Canada was a founding member of 
the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization , the G 20 and the Organisation for Economic 
Co -- operation and Development (( OECD ).[175] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations 
and forums for economic and cultural affairs .[179] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 
1976.[180] Canada joined the Organization of American States (( OAS ) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 
2000 and the 33 rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[181] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim 
economies through membership in the Asia -- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (( APEC ).[182] Canada and the United States share 
the world's longest undefended border , co -- operate on military campaigns and exercises , and are each other's largest 
trading partner .[183][184] Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy , most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba , and 
declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .[185] Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom 
and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the 
Francophonie .[186] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands , owing , in part , to 
its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II .[79]] Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth 
led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War , World War I and World War 
II .[187] Since then , Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism , making efforts to resolve global issues in 
collaboration with other nations .[188][189] During the Cold War , Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the 
Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (( NORAD ) in co -- operation with the United 
States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union .[190] During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime 
Minister Lester B . Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force , for which 
he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize .[191] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission , Pearson is 
often credited as the inventor of the concept .[192] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions , including 
every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[73] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia 
, and elsewhere ; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries , notably in the 1993 
Somalia Affair .[193] In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the U .. S . stabilization force 
and the UN -- authorized , NATO -- led International Security Assistance Force .[194] In February 2007, Canada , Italy 
, the United Kingdom , Norway , and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-- billion project to help 
develop vaccines for developing nations , and called on other countries to join them .[195] In August 2007, Canada's territorial 
claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole ; Canada has considered that 
area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[196]] The nation employs a professional , volunteer military force of approximately 79,000 active 
personnel and 32,250 reserve personnel .[197] The unified Canadian Forces (( CF ) comprise the Canadian Army , Royal Canadian 
Navy , and Royal Canadian Air Force . In 2013, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately C $19 billion , or 
around one percent of the country's GDP .[198][199] Following the 2016 Defence Policy Review , the Canadian government announced a 
70 percent increase to the country's defence budget over the next decade . The Canadian Forces will acquire 88 fighter 
planes and 15 naval surface combatants , the latter as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy . Canada's total 
military expenditure is expected to reach C $32.7 billion by 2027.[200] Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and 
three territories . In turn , these may be grouped into four main regions : Western Canada , Central Canada 
, Atlantic Canada , and Northern Canada (( Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together ). Provinces 
have more autonomy than territories , having responsibility for social programs such as health care , education , and welfare 
.[201] Together , the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government , an almost unique structure among federations in 
the world . Using its spending powers , the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas , such 
as the Canada Health Act ; the provinces can opt out of these , but rarely do so in practice 
. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept 
between the richer and poorer provinces .[202] The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces 
receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act , 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by 
the Parliament of Canada . The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada (( 
the federal government ) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively . A change to the division of powers between 
the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment , whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be 
performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government .[203] Canada is the world's tenth -- largest economy as of 
2018, with a nominal GDP of approximately US $1.73 trillion .[204] It is a member of the Organisation for Economic 
Co -- operation and Development (( OECD ) and the Group of Eight (( G 8), and is one of 
the world's top ten trading nations , with a highly globalized economy .[205][206] Canada is a mixed economy , ranking 
above the U .. S . and most western European nations on The Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom ,[207] 
and experiencing a relatively low level of income disparity .[208] The country's average household disposable income per capita is "" 
well above " the OECD average .[209] Furthermore , the Toronto Stock Exchange is the seventh -- largest stock exchange 
in the world by market capitalization , listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US $2 
trillion as of 2015.[210] In 2014, Canada's exports totalled over CA $528 billion , while its imported goods were worth 
over $524 billion , of which approximately $351 billion originated from the United States , $49 billion from the European 
Union , and $35 billion from China .[212] The country's 2014 trade surplus totalled C $5.1 billion , compared with 
a C $46.9 billion surplus in 2008.[213][214]] Since the early 200 th century , the growth of Canada's manufacturing , 
mining , and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized , industrial one 
.[215] Like many other developed countries , the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry , which employs about 
three -- quarters of the country's workforce .[216] However , Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of 
its primary sector , in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components .[217]] Canada 
is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy .[218] Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits 
of natural gas , and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources . The vastness of the Athabasca oil 
sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13 percent share of global oil reserves , comprising the world's 
third -- largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia .[219] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of 
agricultural products ; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat , canola , and 
other grains .[220] Canada's Department of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports ; the country is a leading 
exporter of zinc , uranium , gold , nickel , aluminum , steel , iron ore , coking coal and 
lead .[221] Many towns in northern Canada , where agriculture is difficult , are sustainable because of nearby mines or 
sources of timber . Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec , with automobiles 
and aeronautics representing particularly important industries .[222]] Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War 
II .[223] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry .[224] 
In the 19700 s , concerns over energy self -- sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime 
Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (( NEP ) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency
